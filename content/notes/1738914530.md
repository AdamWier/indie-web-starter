Today I went to the march√©. I'm so proud of myself! The few times I've gone, thank goodness I was with someone b/c it's A LOT. So many people and noises. It's crowded and I don't understand anything. Today I went right at the opening and there were so few people. I was able to walk through, get the lay of the land, watch how people act, and when I felt ready, I bought avocados. The guy was so nice! He numbered them in ripeness for me!
