I finally worked on a fix I had in mind for cross posting from my site to mastodon tonight. I didn't quite finish but I'm probably 75% there. I should have gone to sleep. I'm leaving for Stockholm tomorrow. But I'm so frustrated with work lately. I spend so much time haranguing people for what I need, writing reports, making PowerPoints and basically doing anything but making things. And all under a lot of pressure. I told a co-worker I'm considering quitting today. We'll see when I get back.
