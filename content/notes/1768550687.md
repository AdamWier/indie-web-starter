I'm not drinking at the moment. For a lot of reasons. I want to lose some weight, improve my sleep, get things done, so on. Point is, I'm now a god damn teetotaler for an unforeseeable amount of time. And so I went to a raclette dinner last night and drank non-alcoholic wine. This morning around 5 am, I woke and I felt hung over. Stomach cramps, head ache, dry mouth, the works. What a scam! Was it the nonalcoholic wine? Too much salt? I don't know but I know it's not fair!
