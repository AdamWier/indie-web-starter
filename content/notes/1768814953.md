Oh no, not me again staring into the camera during a meeting frustrated about the dispersed nature of our conversation before finally telling the whole executive board to stay focused and methodical and to go line by line in the excel I prepared and answer my questions.   
My jaw aches from clenching it for about 45 minutes straight. The stess of trying to keep up with the rapidly changing topics and also finding where to interject was a lot.
