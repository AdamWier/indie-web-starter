It's crazy how getting my sleep cycle messed up can totally throw me into a tailspin. I'm trying not to be resentful but I was convinced to take a fifteen minute nap only for the person to ignore their alarm and we ended up sleeping multiple hours. From basically six pm to nine pm. And I ended up not being able to fall asleep until about four am and slept roughly four hours. The whole day has been a real challenge and I feel like shit.
