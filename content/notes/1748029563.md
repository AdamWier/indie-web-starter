This evening I felt very much like I'd like to see friends but the idea of having to spend the energy of being in the "presence" of another person was something between exhausting and panic inducing. I've been pushing that social battery hard lately. 
It's moments like these when you feel autism as a disability. Like I want to run as fast and long as the others but it's just not happening with one leg.
