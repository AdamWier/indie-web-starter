I think it's also worth noting that at my housewarming party yesterday, when any person said I don't know a lot of people on Signal, I would point out about three people (out of 20~) and say "they're not on Signal but everyone else here is." And that's because I  proselytized to all my friends, setting lines in the sand about how to contact me and expect a response. Little by little, we win.
(I wrote this post largely to tell myself to keep going.)
