As my mental health has improved greatly over about five years of steady talk therapy, EMDR, DBT and who knows what else, (CBT can take a hike. At least for me.) my therapy sessions have slowly shifted from how can I not be in constant crisis and anguish to "expert, please explain why the person is like this." I mean, autism is probably part of it for me, but aren't we all constantly wondering that?
