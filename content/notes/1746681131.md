This morning I'm off to a temple near Blois until Sunday. It's the first time staying at a monastery since I left the United States. It would be dishonest to say I'm not a bit apprehensive. There's things that give me pause. But it's one of the two closest monasteries, and I figured I'd start as local as possible before needing to travel across France to find a place where the dharma is alive and vibrant. Maybe I'll write up my experience on my way back.
