My psychologist told me to make a visual list of things I need to do "recharge" b/c when my battery is @ 0, executive functioning has left the chat. And she said to make sure I include pictures. I made my best to include pictures that inspire a feelingâ„¢. And you know what? It works! I look at those pictures think, "what do I want to feel?" And that's how I had a short impromptu dance party, and it felt like an impromptu artist date.
