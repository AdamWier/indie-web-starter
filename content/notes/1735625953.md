I had a dream that the person next to me in the bus didn't know who David Bowie was and I said I would make a list of three David Bowie songs for him. But then he kept saying he knew this one or that one, he just didn't know that David Bowie was the one who sang it. Anyway, I wrote down Life on Mars before my alarm clock woke me up. He didn't know that one.
