Last night I was hanging out with a friend and we started getting on about how bad the other social media are. And that's when I said, alright I'm signing you up for a mastodon account! Right here, right now! Forced mastodon sign ups! Haha Because explaining it, people seem to have a hard time understanding the concept. And seeing is believing as they say. I will drag us all kicking and screaming into a new, better world. No more Mr. Nice Anarchist! 🤪
