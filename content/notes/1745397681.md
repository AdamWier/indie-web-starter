I hate when the landlady comes over. She's always like looking around and inspecting and commenting. Yes, my apartment is not spotless. Yes it could be better kept up. But I also have a whole damn life I barely have a handle on and I feel comfortable enough in my living space. (I can move around; it's not cluttered.) I'm sure when you're retired and just collecting a renter's check, you have all the time in the world but that ain't me, doll.
