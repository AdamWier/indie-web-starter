Until the yearly renewal, I always forget that after getting high playing games online one night, a friend & I thought up this monstrosity. I put up the site. She did the "sound design & art." It's a bizarre mix of Adult Swim humor & a bit Lynch. ("I kill deer.") We spent years producing theatre together. It was nice to create together again, even frivolous. Anyway pass it on. Like the videotape in The Ring!
