Tonight I broke down with a friend in tears. I spoke about multiple incidents that, in my eyes, have broken the small community I have tried to create. I felt I had lost the family I had worked so hard to create, feeling I've never really had one. I've had a hard time expressing what I feel but I think she's the first to give me a clue on how to get back on my feet. She showed me all is not lost. Pieces are still there to pick up. 

She truly is a good friend.
