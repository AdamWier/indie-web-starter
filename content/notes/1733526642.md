Is it possible to feel homesick for a country that's not yours? For whatever reason, I miss Colombia. While I was there I complained, I was annoyed with things, but I loved that year of my life. I loved the people I met, the adventures I had, and I miss American culture. (Not USian, American.) 

France is great. The quality of life is good. But Americans they are not, and I miss the sense of community, optimism and acceptance that is uniquely American. I <3 you, Colombia.
