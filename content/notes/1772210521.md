I'm reading House Of Leaves for a second time and I think I might go to the library tomorrow to read. Because there's only two ways to read this book: 
1) Like the editor, in a library, studiously
2) Like Zampanò, shutters closed, in the near dark, and a little bit of paranoia

(You could also read it like Johnny, but that's the same as Zampanò but horny.)
