One of the biggest frustrations I have communicating with allistics is when they finally see with their eyes a situation I've been describing and their reaction was, "I thought you were exaggerating!"
No, actually. I mean, we all have our biases that can color our perspectives, but I do this revolutionary thing of.... saying what I mean. Go figure.
