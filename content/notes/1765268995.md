I'm so over the xenophobia in this country. Like, I'm just going to pretend to be mute for now on when I'm out in public. I did that once when I went to a bar. I preferred the treatment I got when they thought I was French but mute than when they knew I was foreign. They actually just talked to me like a normal person. It was nice. Maybe I won't have to "brace for impact" every time I open my mouth.
