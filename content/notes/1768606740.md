So just got finished talking (briefly) to a rare gay French guy who calls himself poly. And it was kind of weird. I'll spare the details but I think what was "weird" about that interaction is that I expect (maybe naively) poly people to be more emotionally intelligent. That was not the case. 

Long story short: I'm fucked. I should just become a monk and call it a life.
