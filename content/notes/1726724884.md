So I guess buying my first apartment is weighing on my subconscious because I just dreamed about it. I went to some realtors who took me to an apartment but it ended up being in the far reaches out Brooklyn. I reminded them I don't live in New York anymore. I live in Nantes, which they said would be too expensive for me. Then a frog showed up, served us Mexican food, and all hell broke lose after that. There were leopard print leotards and everything.
