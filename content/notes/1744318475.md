I'm not going to say who it b/c the point isn't to be mean to someone but I saw a video of a person who said we should fight fascism by making bad art out of trash. Like... What? Someone help me out. Am I missing something or is this liberal idealism? Maybe make art for your mental health so you feel good enough to get out of your house to protest & organize.... But the fascists aren't going to go away just b/c we, like, wished really hard.
