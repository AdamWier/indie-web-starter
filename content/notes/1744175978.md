Sunday morning, I finally went to a zendo here in Nantes. I hadn't been in a zendo/temple/monastery in around ten or eleven years (though I've kept up an off and on practice throughout ). It was such a lovely experience. And an interesting one too. Buddhism transforms itself in every cultural context and France is no exception. It was interesting to see differences in practice between here and the US. And it reignited something in me. I don't know what.
