Had a dream where my credit card got blocked at the dentist and then I had to go all over the place trying to figure out how to get money out of my account. I had to travel through this giant mall to the other side where my bank was so I could talk to the teller. This took a lot of time, and I was very embarrassed with my dentist. He said he knew it'd be a whole thing and that it would take a while for me to figure it out, and he had confidence that I'd come back. What nice guy!
