One of the things I don't understand is how people don't associate degrowth as a strategy to tackle climate change isn't associated with more leisure time. Ideally degrowth would start by stopping over production. That seems to me to lead naturally to less work and more leisure. Am I crazy for that? Is dreaming of leisure that impossible? It isn't if we free ourselves from the tyranny of the profit motive.
