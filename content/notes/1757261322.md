I organized an ap√©ro with my building neighbors. Despites one RSVP and one maybe, I waited an hour and no one came. People just seem uninterested. I say uninterested and not, for example, too busy because I put on the poster to feel free to suggest another date. No one did. I'm a little disappointed but taking it better than I thought I would. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink you know?
