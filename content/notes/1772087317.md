Been struggling with feelings of loss lately. For all sorts of reasons. Time mostly. Yesterday I learned that a third of my short lived throuple moved back to the US. (Though we've actually known each other, in various configurations, for around 13 years.) And I'm bummed about that. And other things. Anyway, listening to this takes me back to when I first escaped Indiana to New York. Thinking about the important things in life.
