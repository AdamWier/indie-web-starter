While I'm complaining: I find it really rich that some clearly wealthy retiree capital owner gave me a lecture about making time to clean, me who has a demanding job, lives alone & is a foreigner (the time spent on admin adds up!). She retorts she had a husband, kids & yard, and I said "did your husband help you?" ("Yes") and reminded her it was a different time without today's pressures. Not to mention how my monocular vision and neurodivergence adds other obstacles; this was not the audience.
