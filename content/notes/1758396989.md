I'm going to bed tonight feeling some kind of way. Life isn't how I want it to be. I'm frustrated with a lot of things and I'm at a point where I have to wait for it to all play out. Again. Sometimes these things happen. But as I constantly get into periods like this, I can only think to look to myself. Blame myself. Which obviously doesn't help how I feel. Anyway, I should probably go to sleep because exhaustion and not respecting my limits is a big part of how I got here
