I had such a lovely day. I woke up, went to the gym an hour before opening, went back home and never went back to the gym. But I did advance some projets. Bought a bike, dishwasher, apartment furniture. All through worker coops, nonprofits & individuals! Then saw an amazing play a friend recommended. Really, truly thankful as hell. Also thankful my work paid me early for Xmas and I could do this stuff. (Even if I give 0 shits about Xmas)
