I have lived through many hard things. I have been dirt poor, which required me to do things I won't go into detail about. I have lived through abuse and mistreatment whose mark will never leave me, no matter how much I try. And I have lived so many lives, and all of those lives must coexist in this sole body, which is hard.

But I have lived a charmed life. I have seen beautiful things and people. I have seen the best and worst of our world. And I feel lucky for it. The best has allowed me to survive, and the worst has allowed me develop a compassion for others and a sense of justice for the world I wish to see.
