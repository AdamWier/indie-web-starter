So I finally turned in the keys to the apartment. The landlord of course did her normal moralizing and commenting but hey at least it's the last time! I moved into the new place Saturday. @ahtynon@mastodon.social helped me paint the Thursday and Friday before. I'm happy to be away from her, that apartment, that situation, that neighborhood, everything. Good riddance Jesus fucking Christ. Now to continue unpacking and furnituring in the new place...
