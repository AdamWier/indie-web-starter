The irony of trying to tell a friend that I feel like another friend keeps cutting me off and interrupting me only to also be cut off by that friend and he doesn't even hear me..... Really I'm ready to host not leave my apartment a whole week. Or two. Or five. Honestly, I kind of am really upset about it and I don't feel great. I'd just go home but one of these people is my house guest for the weekend. 😥
