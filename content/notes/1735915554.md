So I've been working on two things lately: 1) Getting quality sleep and 2) Curbing a few compulsive behaviors that aren't doing me any favors. (Don't worry, nothing serious.) And when you're trying to stop bad habits and start new ones, I'm realizing that sliding back into your old ones can happen quite insidiously. So, you know, that kind of sucks.
