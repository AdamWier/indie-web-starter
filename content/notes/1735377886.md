I was getting to many strain-based injuries and decided to take a week off from lifting. I've been focusing on getting better sleep, which means about 10 to 11 hours in bed between reading, sleeping, and waking up every three hours for 15 minutes to an hour and a half. I'm actually catching up on sleep but waking up with mild headaches is drawing it out. Maybe it's caffeine withdraw? I decided to cut down around the same time. Thoughts?
