This came up while assembling my Thanksgiving playlist (we're doing it late), and I flashed back to many years ago... Before France, before Colombia. When I left New York. I was putting together a playlist for my boyfriend, and then we broke up. I still finished the playlist, but it evolved, of course. And this, I think, was the first song. He had just started doing drag. And he was very good. As far as I know, he's still doing it.
