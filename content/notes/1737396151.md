I left the big social networks not long after the election results, before Zuckerburg morphed into (dick)Suckerburger. Being called "paranoid" and "dramatic", most people thought it was about surveillance, but the primary reason was wanting to have a *pleasant* place on the internet. Now that many Americans are being confronted with the Twitterfication of Facebook and soon TikTok, I think maybe they might finally be picking up what a lot of us are throwing down.
