Sad to skip deadlifts today. But as soon as I feel anything out of the ordinary I say nope. I once injured myself so bad that I'm pretty sure it what triggered a non cancerous tumor that I had to be operated on to remove. Not to mention the pain I was in for a week or two. It's my weakest lift and my favorite lift but I'd rather be cautious and be able to come back tomorrow than be out for a week or more because I was stubborn.
