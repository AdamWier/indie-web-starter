I'm in need of communication advice. I often need to ask a series of yes/no questions to understand something but people often respond with a very long answer to the first question and there is neither yes or no (or maybe or I don't know) in the long answer. How can I politely tell them to stay on topic and to please just answer my question? Should I interrupt their long answer? I try to wait till the end, but then I have to hold a lot in my head, which is hard for me
