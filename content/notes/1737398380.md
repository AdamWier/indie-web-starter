I watch a lot of fitness Youtube content, which is of course rife with right wing (adjacent) assholes. Jeff Nippard's great, been watching him for almost a decade at this point, but another Youtuber who doesn't get as much traction is Adam/The Bioneer. I've noticed his channel pushing back against focusing on aesthetics over actual health. In this capitalistic, image-driven world, his videos bring me back to Earth. I also think he's silly & handsome.
