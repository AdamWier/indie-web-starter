I had a nice little cry. I do mean nice. A certain song was playing, the rain was coming down hard but pleasantly, and my mind drifted to an anchor partner that things recently ended with and I was wondering if he's doing okay and... I ended up weeping. It felt nice to just kind of let myself feel a sadness I've been ignoring for several days. Healthy even. And that's very different from how I would have handled Big Emotionsâ„¢ a few years ago.

I miss him though.
