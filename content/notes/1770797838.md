Sad news: The menu/start button of my Steam Deck seems kaput. I bought it used roughly under a year ago so I guess that's how the cookie crumbles. So I started looking up my options. Sending it away, repairing it myself... Self repairs seemed doable but slightly risky. Then I remembered those back buttons that I barely have use for! I'll just remap them and wait till I have a game that causes problems with. Sometimes the solution is simpler than we think!
