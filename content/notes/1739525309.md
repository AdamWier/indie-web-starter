Shout out to the guy who took the time to explain to me how to get out of the Metro when my e-ticket didn't work instead of his colleague who heard one syllable of my accent and yelled at me "it's okay, it's okay!!" in English and walked away. I tried to tell him, "no I'd like to know what to do for next time" but you know accent means foreign which means can't possibly live in France because everyone knows France is only for native born French people.
