So yesterday, I got called into HR's office, and I was like, "Oh no, I must have gotten a little real in a political conversation with someone recently."  
And, in fact, it was to ask if I wanted to the company to write a letter to bring with me to my naturalization interview or if there was anything else they could do to help!  
There isn't at the point, but I could tell they were very excited for me and wanted to do what they could and that was really very nice of them. 🥰
