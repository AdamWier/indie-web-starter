One of the unfortunate things about people always treating you weird because of being a foreigner is that you get a little paranoid about it. You start wondering did they do or say this thing because you're a foreigner and they're being weird or xenophobic or am I attributing their actions to that when in reality they're just a garden variety asshole. You get so in your head about it when you get these constant microagressions and I think that's the real insidious part of it all.
