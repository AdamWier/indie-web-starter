"Wow, you've lived so many lives"

Yep it's one of the reasons people are constantly underestimating me. That and the fact that I look around ten years younger than I am. 

I normally don't mind (too much) but I'm very frustrated lately. 

Add in that because of my accent people talk to me like I'm dumb and... Well... I'm sure you can figure out how I might feel.
