I saw a physical therapist to start running again. He gave me a program to follow, and as I was "running" today, I was listening to Miike Snow's self titled album. What a blast from the past! The song "Sylvia" instantly transported me back in time: running through Central Park at night, stopping at Belvedere Castle, going up to the tower and looking out, listening to this song.

"When the lights go out, will there be a trace that I loved Sylvia?"
