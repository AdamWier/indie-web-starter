So it's vacation season and I saw this British family say something about spicy food. In France. Lord have mercy. And they saw me smirk at their reactions. And I then imagined this conversation... 
Them: Do you find it funny? 
Me: Yes but I'm not French, at least not yet. 
Them: You want to be French? With everything going on here? 
Me: Yes well they have a long history of decapitating kings instead of keeping them as nationwide house pets that I can take get into. 💁
