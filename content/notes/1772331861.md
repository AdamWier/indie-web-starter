Man rough night. Came home from a party where I felt really out of place and then someone comments on my last loops video chewing me out like we're back on the fashosphere networks. Like real Twitter like behavior. Some nights you just can't win, amiright... 😓  
Tomorrow I'm hiding our little coffee klatch so wish your boy some much that the sleep will help me forget all this and put me in a good mood that helps put others in a good mood and not whatever I'm feeling right now.
