There is nothing more angering than this thing French people do... Where they ask me, a USian, about something they find politically strange or unjust about the US and when I go to try to explain why things are the way they are, they cut me off to basically just continue to denigrate our system. Don't get me wrong, I think our system is fucked but these same people would flip their shit if I did the same thing about France.
