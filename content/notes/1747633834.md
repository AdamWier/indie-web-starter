Lately I've been ramping up pushing Signal to people I text regularly through other apps. The conversation tends to go like this after I get a message:
Me: (responding to message and then:) By the way, I'm not really on (whatever this app is) anymore. I use Signal pretty exclusively now.
Them: Oh, I don't have Signal.
Me: Darn
I've made my choice, you made your choice. You know where to find me. Big. Shrug.
(That being said, some people do say oh I'll download it!)
