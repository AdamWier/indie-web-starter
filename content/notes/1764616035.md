So here's something I didn't expect since I went Signal-only on my messengers (and drew a pretty distinct line in the sand to about everyone I know: Signal or SMS, nothing else). When I meet a new person (especially in a more romantic capacity) and the vibes are really vibing, it turns out either they have Signal or are willing to download it to communicate with me. Protecting your data is sexy. 🫦
