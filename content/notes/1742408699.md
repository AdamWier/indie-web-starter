People are out tonight! I decided to come out, drink a beer en terrasse and read a book, and I've got all these little slices of life. A father and son desperately trying to relate to each other, two ladies laughing, very much enjoying each other's company, a man with an Asian tourist(?) who wanted a pint, so the former replied "well we need to go over to that bar invest! They're Irish! They're beer specialists!" What an evening, what a treat!
