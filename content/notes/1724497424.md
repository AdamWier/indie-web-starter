I'm in a Catalonian restaurant in Vannes. (Yay anarchy. Because iykyk.) And I'm trying to document a strange feeling I have. I feel... Awkward and I'm not sure why. I'm raw dogging the ambient sound w/o my ear plugs so maybe that's part of it. It's like I don't know where to look or how to be. Even writing this on my phone feels weird. Where's this weirdness coming from? Maybe just a malaise at being with my own thoughts?
