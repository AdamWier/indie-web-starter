I was just thinking about someone I crossed paths with years ago. A classmate in my Tribal Religions class. They had a such an impact on me without even knowing it probably. (I also had a crush on them.) I was wondering where they are, how they are, if they would even remember me, if they're still alive. (Idk why but sometimes that crosses my mind.) We didn't interact all that much. They probably don't know this. Funny how it can work like that sometimes
