I thought my earbuds were goners. I plugged them in and the charge light wouldn't light up. But I left them plugged in a full day just in case. Still no charge light. I unplugged and then plugged them in because I don't know why. I thought they were dead. And now they're charging! Praise be for they have risen!!!!! Hahahahaha It's an early Easter miracle before Christmas!! 😂
