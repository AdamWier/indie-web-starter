At the gym...
Me (in French): Are you using the space over there? 
Them (in English): Yes, of course!
So I start walking away and then they say in French, "no I'm not using it."
See, France? This is why you should just stick to speaking back to someone in the language they spoke to you in. We're all communicating worse. You're not even listening to me. And I'm supposed to consider this "welcoming"?
(I also don't need to be "welcomed" in my own home.)
