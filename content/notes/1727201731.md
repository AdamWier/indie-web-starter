The tyranny of the algorithm. The one last site that I couldn't tear myself away from but had one was YouTube. I recently learned YouTube channels have RSS feeds. I am finally free. There is no algorithm on my social media now. And let me tell you, I am unbothered, moisturized, happy, in my lane, focused, flourishing. 

(You all are great here on Mastodon by the way.)
