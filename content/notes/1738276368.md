If you know Vonnegut, perhaps you know the concept of a karass. Tonight I saw a lot of old co-workers, people who were there when I started a new chapter of my life, and them as well. There was a lot of mutual understanding that we had some kind of special chemistry together. I think that was a karass. And now that the last one has left the company, I still had no trouble see you next time. Because we will see each other again. We are a karass.
