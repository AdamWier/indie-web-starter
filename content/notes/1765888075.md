I just had a memory of a sun dial my father made and gave to me. I didn't really know him. He moved across the country after my parents divorced, when I was 7 or so. I wonder where it is now. I think my mom threw it away along with all of my belongings at a moment when we weren't speaking. I feel like I lost everything before France in a fire and not much is left of that time. It really messes with your head to have no trace of who you were before 27.
