I know it's the 80s and maybe I'm supposed to read it that way and not like a "today" way. And maybe it's because I was too dumb to be closeted as a child because of the tism. But the coming out scene in Stranger Things was cringe as hell. Actually I'm just annoyed with Noah's character in general.  
Oh and that fear of your straight friends growing apart from you? They won't. Until they have children and a family and you don't. Then they'll drift away.  
Okay. I've had my "🙄" moment.
