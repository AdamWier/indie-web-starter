I haven't written anything here since the election. I'm not a public figure, I'm not producing "content." I'm just a person who feels incredibly lost. I didn't expect it to be like that. I don't think many did. The US must have changed in the 10 years since I left. The desire to give up is strong. The feeling of helplessness is palpable. But it's in these times that we must look to each other for strength and find the will to carry on. We have no choice
