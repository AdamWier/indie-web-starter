While I'm on the subject... I'm always angered by how if the person is racialized, French people will go on and on about how they need to integrate, speak French, and basically abandon their culture of origin, but as a white American, they expect the opposite. They'll speak to me in English, they'll constantly reference the US, actively standing in the way of this "integration." When people speak to me in English, this racism becomes apparent.
