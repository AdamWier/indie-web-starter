I recently unfollowed most non mutuals and found out how to hide all boosts and I'm back to really enjoying Mastodon again. It's so great to see all the nice people I follow again: your thoughts, little snippets of your lives, random things found elsewhere on the internet. Don't get me wrong: Boost away. I'll switch them back on occasionally, but one of the things I like about the fediverse is the more personal feel it has. Anyway, have a good day!
