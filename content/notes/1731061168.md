Sometimes friends say stupid shit. And you can only take a patient, pedagogic approach for so long. You've explained that it's not okay, that it crosses boundaries. And sometimes you've just got to say I can't anymore. And that friendship ends. That happened to me today and it's unfortunate and I'm sad about it but I don't regret it. I did all I could and having done that, I have nothing else to give. Good bye.
