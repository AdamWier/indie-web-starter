If you still need journaling music/going to sleep music that's not shitty New Age that all sounds like the last one/pensive night alone music thinking about all the moments that chained together to lead you here, here's another suggestion. The whole album, start to finish, by Mogwai: "Come On Die Young". But the cover gives me the creeps. It brings me back to those Marble Hornet days
