Damn ok. Here's my unpopular opinion opinion for the night: if you see religion and leftism as being antithetical, you've lost the plot, honey. They're, in essence, the same thing. So critique those power structures, but the phenomenon itself, it's your friend, not your enemy. Both are pointing to the same thing.
