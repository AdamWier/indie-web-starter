Lol @ the person who said "oh so you're American but you only speak English" and then I answered him back in two other languages and then he said "but those are the only phrases you know right?"

I have a degree in translation and interpretation. Including UN-style simultaneous interpretation. ðŸ™„

I them asked this person what other languages they speak. The said some French and some Irish, which they both forgot.

Alright.....
