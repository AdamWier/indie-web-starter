You can be at a table, as an American with French people and they'll discuss your country for an hour without a single question. They'll tell you where they were for 9/11 at length but they won't ask where you were. They'll talk about the lack of access to health care, education and gun violence but if I don't impose myself, nothing. The US is just a fake lala land for their favorite series. I feel like someone from the future to warn them what will happen but they are uninterested in listening
