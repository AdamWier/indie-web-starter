I'm going to bed b/c I'm clearly at my limit. Apparently "that's true" means yes? I told them to me that's neither a yes or no. They said they didn't know what to say, & so I gave them suggestions, and then they accused me "accusatory inversion" (I don't know what that is... "l'inversion accusatoire") and when I wanted to call to explain, they refused and said they didn't want to talk to me again. A whole avalanche of past experiences fell on me & I had a little cry. So bed.
