OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD! Remember when I said I wanted to get back into piano?? The reservation I put in for a keyboard at the library many moons ago came in today! AND I had planned on going to read at the library tomorrow! There's surely a way for me to construct some meaning out of all these random coincidences!
