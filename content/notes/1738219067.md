It's not a great morning. Sick again, my workout was shit. Tired, stressed. My blood pressure is back up to premedication levels but now WITH medication. My sleep choices are either 1) go to sleep early, have my sleep cut into two or three sections over the course of about 9 hours but feel ok (but not great) or 2) sleep six hours peacefully but have way less energy. I have a dr's appointment tomorrow, but honestly, life doesn't feel worth living right now.
