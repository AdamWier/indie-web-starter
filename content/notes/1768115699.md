So for my Buddhist study for the week, I've been going through the Japanese version of the Heart Sutra, kanji by kanji, and looking up what that kanji means in the dictionary. Why would I do this sometimes grueling task? Well, in France, unlike the US, they chant almost exclusively in Sino-Japanese, and I dislike that for several reasons. So the best compromise I could come up with is to look up what all those sounds mean and give sense to them.
