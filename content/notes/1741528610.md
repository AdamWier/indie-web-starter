Today I finished a mala using bodhi seeds a friend gave me when he came back from China. I've had it for at least six months would do a little and then stop and today I said "I'm going to finish!" And what did I notice right as I was tying the last knot? The tassel had fallen apart! I tried to no avail to put it back together and back on. Anyway, it's finished now, tassel or not, and I'm sure there's a lesson in there somewhere
