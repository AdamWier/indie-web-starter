My solution to everything these days is to listen to Nora Jones. Trump's inaguration? Put on Nora Jones instead! Stressed at work? Get that Nora Jones playlist out! Feel existential dread creeping up? ðŸŽµ"Sunrise, sunrise, it's like morning in your eyes...."ðŸŽµ I don't even like Nora Jones!!! But it works!
