Lately I've been thinking about people who I've lost contact with. And I wonder where they are, how they're doing. One of my closest friends till we had a falling out, a guy I dated for a brief moment and the strange world he lived in, the one that got away, my temporary room mate in Harlem during acting school, my closest confidant in Colombia... All these people they touched me but I no longer know them. We can't stay in contact with everyone but saying good bye is hard, I guess
