I'm having feelings again tonight about my place in the world. I feel so out of place and it's because of ideas I have about the world, humanity, all of us.... And how much that feels in conflict with... just everything around me. And despite all signs, people, whatever telling me I'm wrong, I just can't believe it.... I can't see the way I am or whatever I am as anything other than an expression of humanity trying to save itself.
