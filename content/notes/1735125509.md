So I've started washing dishes with a basin for rinsing and the sink filled with soapy water instead of letting the faucet run. I did this mostly for ecological reasons but a surprise benefit is that sensory wise, it is far more enjoyable. I really like water and instead of being hit with it, dipping my hands to wash in the hot earn and then contrasting with the cold in the basin is really nice. It's almost relaxing to wash dishes now instead of stressful &:torturous
