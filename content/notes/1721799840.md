Well here we are. Another morning. I slept well. No dreams. Sound sleep. I did wake up a little panicked that I had overslept. Partially because I felt rested and that's unfortunate but partially because I woke up later than usual and forgot that that's what I had planned. No gym Wednesday mornings. Just sleep. I wrote in my journal listening to this https://youtu.be/Ln7na0GMEnc and finished my coffee and now I have ample time to get ready for work #sleep #work #morning #insomnia #dreams #gym
