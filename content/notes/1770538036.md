I woke up feeling pretty grand all things considered! So I'm back to the gym after a few days break. Oh and that pi hole? A few adjustments to make but it's basically working! I had to temporarily disable IPv6 on my computer and a few apps on my phone aren't working but I already found a few things to try to fix all that. So, uh, I guess ya boy's back in action, ready to be an absolute MENACE once again in the city of Nantes ! Not even the Batman can stop me! 🤪😈
