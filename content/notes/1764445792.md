So I got backlinking working again for my Mastodon posts onto my site. So basically, I've effectively replaced the rickety github action that did my cross posting. I also added a link to my BookWyrm account finally. Even if I've been neglecting it ever since my e-read bit the dust. 
It's nice to finally get to work on some things. I would have liked to do more but I feel my energy and concentration wearing down. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally finish my watch app. Or put up shelves!
