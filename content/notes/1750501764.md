For a while, I've been posting on Loops, almost daily till recently. Even though I have a harder time speaking eloquently than writing, I like it because it helps us remember there are people behind all these interactions. But it definitely doesn't get the interaction it does here and I miss being able to talk to other people. So, I need to think about what I want to do for my social media time because I don't think I have the energy for both.
