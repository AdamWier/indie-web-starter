I have discovered a new autistic horror. Those company workshops where people have to talk about their values and do group brainstorming. It's a oneway ticket to alienation seeing how out of a phase with others you are with either the form or the foundation of your answers. Add in, trying to ask questions to understand what you're supposed to be doing and the facilitator just repeats the directions again. It's a frustrating and depression experience.
