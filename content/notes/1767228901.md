New year over here. Despite me. I'm not sure if last year was good or bad. Honestly, I don't care. Yesterday is a memory. Tomorrow is a dream. There is only today. When I say this to people they somehow think this is a saccrinly empty thing to say. It's not. It's just the truth. It would only seem saccrine to someone who's afraid of the nature of reality. Anyway I'm drunk. So you know don't listen to me. Just have another day & take advantage of the moment to yell a bunch b/c that's always nice
