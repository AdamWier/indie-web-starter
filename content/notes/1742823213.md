Ever have something that you have to do that is just so boring and dull that it feels literally painful to do? That's me filling out the preparation sheet for my yearly evaluation.

I also used to feel this when I had to write student evaluations as a teacher.

Maybe I just hate evaluations..... Abolish grades.
