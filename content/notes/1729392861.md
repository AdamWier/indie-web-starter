Anyone else crying their eyes out because you had to break up with a guy for his own good, because he couldn't be polyaccepting anymore than you could be monogamous? I've had so much else going on in my life that I think it's only a month after that I can do my grievance. I'm a mess tonight. We really love(d) each other and tried so hard.
