My lights didn't turn on to wake me up! And home assistant's last trace is sometime in November so I have no idea why! (By the way, if any other home assistant users are reading this and know why I don't have traces that are, like, in this month, let me know!) But I guess I needed the sleep and the only repercussion is that I missed the gym this morning. At least I feel rested!  

Anyway, uh.... Good morning!
