I have awoken with a particularly low level of hope & faith. The revolutionary optimism I've wavered in but always came back to seems gone for good. It's been on a steep decline for 6 months b/c of both personal & political situations. My values haven't changed, but the energy to enact them is gone. I feel defeated & I'm not sure what to do about it. Advice? 

Otherwise I'm going to a monastery & it's the monastic life for me
