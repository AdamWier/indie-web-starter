I had a technique focused day for the first time in forever, and it felt so good. I was feeling worn down and starting to dread my workout, which was really my body asking me to stop stressing it out so much. This technique week is going to do me some good, so I can get back to lifting heavy next week. I think it's going to be my go-to when my body is yelling at me to take it down a notch for a second. Really, this is a wake up call to start considering my mesocycle way more.
