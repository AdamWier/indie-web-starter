I had a technique focused day for the first time in forever, and it felt so good. I was feeling worn down, starting to dread my workout, which was my body asking me to stop stressing it out. A technique week is going to do me good, so I can get back to lifting heavy. This is a wake up call to start considering my mesocycle way more
