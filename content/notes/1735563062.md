So I do my best to look at leboncoin (like craigslist for France) & buy 2nd hand things. Good for ecological reasons of course, but I forgot about a pleasant side effect: resisting commodity fetishism, even if in a small, personal way. When it's local, you meet people, often end up even going to their homes, & subtly the exchange becomes just slightly less commodity for commodity & instead between two people. I recommend it if even just for your mental health
