Headed to Le Mans today for the weekend. Le Mans is the city I lived in when I first arrived in France. I lived there three years. It's not a great place. I think the people there aren't very open. I made more friends in one year in Nantes then I did in three in Le Mans. But the friends I do have there are some of the best. One of them is celebrating her birthday this weekend. It'll be a nice change of pace, I hope.
