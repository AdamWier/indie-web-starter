I'm an anarchist. And with that I have faith that in the right circumstances, people are generous & solidaire & good & helpful & everything. But oh god damn do I have moments where I'm like "why are you all this oblivious?" It's just it's not the right circumstances, but come ooooonnnnnn. Help a guy out

Anyway, reading The Dispossessed is this year's Ecotopia for me. It's my little hopium book
