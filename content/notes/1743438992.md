It was bound to come to an end. After 5 days in the Netherlands, I must return to France. FR is my home but there's something about NL that just clicks.

Maybe it's because I'm a New Amsterdamer (i.e. New Yorker). Maybe because one of my dearest friends lives here, and I've made more friends every time I've visited. Maybe the grass is always greener... But my heart is here more and more... 

What did they say again about where home is?
