I have lived far & been estranged from most of my family for some time. I've grown accustomed to celebrating Christmas alone. Shocking to some but absolutely delightful to me. Here's the yearly plan.

Christmas Eve: Making egg nog, raclette dinner and a film that is heartwarming but not too cheesy. This year: My Neighbor Totoro

Christmas day: drinking the eggnog, making cookies and a new video game. This year: Stray

Let the eggnog making commence!
