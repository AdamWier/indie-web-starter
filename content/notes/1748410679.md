I'm so depressed. I've spent two months cutting down alcohol, doing more cardio, losing a bit of weight and trying my best to avoid stress, and my blood pressure has not changed all that much. I'm nervous they're going to try to change my medicine again, and it'll be like last time where I wanted to throw myself out of the window because of all the side effects: dizziness, depression, anxiety, lethargy, headache and general malaise. I'm feel frustrated and discouraged.
