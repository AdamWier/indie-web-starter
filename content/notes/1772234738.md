Relistening to half alive: I am deeply religious but not Christian. Those symbols are closed off due to past experiences. But the songs of Sufjan or half alive speak to me. Why? I think perhaps religion w/o mystical experience is useless. Anyway this is my favorite verse from The Dark Night of the Soul (trans., mine):  
In the blessed night  
In secret, completely unseen  
And seeing nothing  
With no light to guide  
But the one that in my heart gleamed  

#religion #sufjan #halfalive #religion
