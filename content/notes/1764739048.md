So I was listening to Ellie Goulding on the walk to the gym and I instantly flashed back to planning out "Bridget and Janice Bring The Dance Dance Revolution" (working title) with @ahtynon@mastodon.social while we were sloshed in Brighton.   
Basically it's communist Footloose with Dance Dance Revolution and the power of friendship.
