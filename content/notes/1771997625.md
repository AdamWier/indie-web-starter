Super light headed at the gym today. Felt it during my deadlift warmups and full on noped my top set before it barely got off the ground. Not sure what's up. Not enough sleep? Diet finally affecting my energy levels? My blood pressure was low for me (good range for most people). Maybe that? No idea but a bit frustrated.
