It turns out Music for Airports can also be Music for Aquariums. I just left the aquarium in Lisbon. I had to put on music because the noise of the families, people snapping photos more than looking, and the general chaos was just not the experience I wanted. (Also: poor fish.) But Brian Eno saved the day. 

I wonder if this compulsion for photos comes from our society's deep seeded need for owning things.
