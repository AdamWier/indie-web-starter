Yesterday I had my 1st meltdown in months. Fridge broke & I had to throw out all food, work was stressful, my routine has been disturbed for 2~ weeks, I've been dealing with allergies for the 1st time, robbing what little balance I have, i.e. I am dropping & breaking everything, having trouble typing & clicking, burning myself, which is what triggered it though the signs were there for hours. I'm hoping today'll be better. So far, so good, but I'm already beat.
