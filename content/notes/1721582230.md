I'm not ready for the week to start. At least I'm working from home tomorrow. At my old job I worked from home Tuesday through Thursday. Now only Monday and Friday but those days, especially Monday, has completely changed my life. Having a day to ease back in is so very necessary to avoid have a breakdown in the bathroom. #work #workfromhome #allworkandnoplay #actuallyautistic #neurodivergent #anxiety #socialanxiety #pressure #worklifebalance #burnout #burnoutprevention #mentalhealth #autism
