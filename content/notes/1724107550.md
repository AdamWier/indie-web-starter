Just woke up in the middle of the night. No idea why. Also my ear felt weird. Hope I'm not getting an infection. Feels slightly better now that I've cleaned it out. Took some CBD oil. Hopefully that'll help. I really did try to get to bed at a decent hour. Not sure why I ended up waking up.... Again. Just two, three hours later.
