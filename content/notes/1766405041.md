I have a dishwasher delivery today! I should be very excited but I'm actually nervous. I know part of it is because I'm nervous about the size. Also I don't know when they're coming other than "the afternoon" and also sometimes I mistake excitedness and nervousness. Or excitedness becomes nervousness if there's at least the slightest reason. Anyway, it's totally disproportionate to the situation but yeah, I might need to take some deep breaths.
