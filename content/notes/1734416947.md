Took a week off the gym and came back today with a light workout and I'm feeling pretty good, despite a night interrupted by nightmares and vivid dreams. I can't remember what scared me, but I remember I had to turn the lights on for a while, which obviously didn't help me fall back to sleep quickly. Anyway, I feel pretty good now, so you know, there's that!
