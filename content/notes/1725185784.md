Last night I ran a game of 10 Candles. Juggling and remembering all the information isn't easy for my little hamster brain. It's even harder with inattentive players who need the rules reexplained up to the very end of the game and sometimes even just what's currently happening. I kind of wonder what I'm doing wrong. If anyone has advice, I'm all ears.
