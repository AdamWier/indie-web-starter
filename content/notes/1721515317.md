Well my little IndieWeb, one-person hackathon has come to its end. I'm happy with the work I've done. The ability to post status updates directly to the site from my phone, syndicate then to mastodon, write blog posts, all marked up in microformats, receiving web mentions, h card, GitHub activity, and pulling what book I'm currently reading from open library.
