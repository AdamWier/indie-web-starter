Someone I considered a friend has done something so horrible and unthinkable... I didn't believe such people could be there in your life, seemingly kind and good, and then when they think no one is watching... 
I'm sorry for the vague posting but if I went into details, I'd need to put content warnings and honestly I don't want to be associated with someone like that. I'm in shock. And something in me feels shaken. I feel transported to the twilight zone. My faith in humanity has taken a hit.
