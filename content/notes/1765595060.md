One of my new superpowers in "debating" (I prefer a dialectic really) is just saying "I don't care." Or "Why is that important?" 

"No matter what society you imagine, people will always try to take advantage of it." => I don't care.

"But I might miss something on my timeline." => Why is that important? 

Give it a try!
