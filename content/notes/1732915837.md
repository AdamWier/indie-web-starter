So one of the reasons they motivated me to come to Rennes was that I wanted to "be someone else" for a little moment. And I think before I fall asleep tonight, I should think about who I want to be. Tomorrow. 

I wanted to go somewhere where no one knows me and be a different person. What mask do I want to try on for a full day?
