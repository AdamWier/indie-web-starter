You guys I'm having a rough time. 3.5 months ago I decided to buy an apartment (this is good news) but I'm still trying to get things approved with no move in date still. Meanwhile, my fridge is broken and replacing it now would be an exercise in frustration. Half my apartment is in boxes and has become completely inaccessible because if I don't start early, I'll have a very Bad Time when the time comes to move. And this apartment is just the worst. I'm not coping. ðŸ¥²
