Community building is one of the most important, but often overlooked, forms of activism. Organize that book club, get together people you know to swap old clothes and items, invite your neighbors over for coffee and cake. It's harder to turns people against their neighbors when they actually know them and see them as humans. And you never know what might come out of it.
