I'm going to bed. Happy to have spent the night hanging with those that make me realize a revolution is not completely impossible. If you're a leftist and you don't have a few leftist friends you can get with, think through things together, reinforce each other a little and dream together, get them. We all need our refuge from time to time as we continue to fight.
