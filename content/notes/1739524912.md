Oh gosh. I'm on my second train of two on this trip and the tray table won't stay up and the seats are much smaller than a TGV. I'm gonna make it; I've gone through worse (like riding a Chinatown bus soaking wet after having spent the night in the Boston bus station), but I am miffed that I could have afforded a better situation if I had not waited to buy tickets. It's crazy how a ticket can shoot up 50 euros overnight but well, they do!
