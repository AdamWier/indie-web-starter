Today is not going to go as planned. I should have started facing that fact when I woke up at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep because of the sound of water running through the pipes. So here we go. Let's make the best of it anyway. The gym might be out of the question again, but I'll be able to take my bike out for a second time to get to the hardware store. (15 minutes on bike instead of 35 in public transport!) Maybe tomorrow will go a bit better and today is not lost.
