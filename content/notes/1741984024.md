This is an appreciation post for my doctor. She's the best. (I have hypertension that so far has not really responded to any treatment. I've had it off and on since I was a teenager but these days it's more on than off.) I see her quite regularly and she just got back from maternity leave! It was nice to see her and she takes such great care of me that I feel like I needed to send that appreciation into the universe.
