A project manager asked me how we save the data for our application. "Do you keep it in folders?" he asked me. And I was like "I don't even know how to answer that question." (Like in a way that would make sense to someone who thinks we're saving separate files) So I tried to explain to him what mongodb timeseries collections are and I think he might have accidentally phase shifted into the shadow zone. Sorry about that!
