Thinking tonight about how alone and not alone I am. How powerless and powerful I (we?) are in the face of insurmountable odds to save us all. I am facing a tsunami, remembering that I am also mostly water. I have no words of motivation. I cannot weave a linguistic spell to bring hope. But I hope nonetheless.
