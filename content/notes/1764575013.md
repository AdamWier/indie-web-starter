I slept so poorly last night. I want to bed at 10pm and feel asleep after 2am. I was supposed to wake up at 5am, but let me tell you, that did not happen. No idea why. Maybe playing Fear and Hunger 2 before bed? But I was just running around, collecting loot in places I forgot it and fighting a few enemies I forgot but now can oneshot here and there. It's not like I was doing anything spooky! Anyway, good morning!
