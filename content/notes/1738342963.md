As I attempt to find truly New Ways of Being (manifesto callback for the ones who know), I'm doing my best to integrate art practice back into my life. I just wrote the beginning of what may end up being a rather long story, though it started in my mind as a single scene inspired by mental images I had listening to certain music. I don't think I want to post anything just yet but I'm happy that I'm back to writing, a part of myself I let go for the last seven or so years
