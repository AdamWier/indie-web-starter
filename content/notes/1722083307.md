I had a friend over for movie night to watch X and Pearl before seeing MaXXXine. Let me tell you... Superbly done. There was style, intrigue, suspense, compelling characters and the right use of retro to make it feel all the more unnerving. The parallels between the Spanish Flu and COVID were well done. Possible for a himbo like me to pick them up on but not over the top. Highly recommend! #x #xfilm #pearl #horror #film #movies #films #horrorfilms #horrormovies #suspense #thriller
