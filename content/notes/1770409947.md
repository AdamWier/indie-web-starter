I'm watching the last season of Stranger Things against my better judgement because of sunken cost fallacy and that I'm sick on the couch, but Erica and the pie scene got me. Also Holly talking to a picture of one hit wonder Tiffany before saying, "why am I talking to you? You're a popstar. You don't know anything about monsters" and then swatting the picture across a table. At least there's little moments that are quite enjoyable.
