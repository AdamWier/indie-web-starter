Tonight I got to talk a few hours with a friend I hadn't seen in a long while. And who I had forgotten I had that much in common with. And that much respect for.  
It was nice. It brought me back down to Earth again, a little off the edge. A little glimmer of hope in this exhaustion and despair I've been feeling towards "humanity at large" lately.  
I still feel as uncertain as ever where to take myself, but I know at least I'm a little less alone.
