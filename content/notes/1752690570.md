In EN, the word "work" comes from "do." In FR, "torture." Think about the difference in perspective. I do. It comes up as a US leftist in France, trying to communicate my ideas. In Pravic (I recently finished The Dispossessed by Ursula K. LeGuin), same word for work & play. In Ecotopia, the protagonist remarked on how work and play seemed to go hand in hand. Think on that. It's a koan, maybe.
