Just ended a three hour video chat with my boys. I know I'm high on New Relationship Energyâ„¢ but the number of times we all had the urge to jump through the screen to hug each other is... A lot of times! This is my first time trying to make a long distance relationship work. Largely because before I don't think I had the maturity and, let's face it, the financial means to make it viable. We just made plans for them to come in June for my birthday. ðŸ¥°
