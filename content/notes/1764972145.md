Another song memory tonight: A friend I made in Colombia (but American) came to Nantes. It was maybe my first year in Nantes. This song played b/c I had just discovered Beirut. She heard the lyric in the song, "it's been a long time, long time now since I've seen you smile" and she turned to me and said, "I haven't seen you this happy in a long time." I remember that little moment.
