I walked into a shop where I go to buy vital wheat gluten in bulk (a big 5kg sack that lasts me about three to four months). And after a few minutes, one of the employees walks over to me and asks, "will you be needing me to go get a big sack of wheat gluten?" (They keep them in the storage across the street.) And I laughed and said, "yeah that's me." I was CALLED OUT. ðŸ˜‚
