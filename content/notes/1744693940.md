I have a friend with an internet radio that I might be doing themed playlists for, and one of the first ideas I had was something like "protest music that doesn't suck." As I start compiling this list (which goes from Chumbawumba to Dolly Parton to Linkin Park to System of a Down), I'm wondering if he's going to maybe tell me to come back with something a little tamer. But at worst, I'll share it with all of you. <3
