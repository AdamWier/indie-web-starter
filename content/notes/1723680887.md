I dream of a world where the idea that we should be generous with our love, that we should love ourselves and each other, with all the work that that implies, is no longer something radical. That love is an act we do in appreciation for the existence of someone and not something we receive and depend on. That it is done for its own sake. I hope this makes sense. I hope I'm being coherent.
