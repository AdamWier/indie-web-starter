Flash back to presenting an application. The consortium wanted people to sign up for the competence center. To help them out, I repeated "You can ask about it on the competence center." Then I did a call and response: "And where you can you ask about that?" I was met with the dead silence of 20 Portuguese wine farmers only to have the one other American yell "The competence center!" They said that it was a very American way to present, but you know, I had fun! 🤭
