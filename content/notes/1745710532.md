Y'all I speak French very well, even if I have a Joseph Conrad level accent. But I had a difficult moment tonight over the word d√©couvrir. Apparently that means you can ask questions. To me, it just meant find out, when used as a command in French. Cue more you know star,I guess. But this actually caused some friction tonight.
