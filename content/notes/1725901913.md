I feel so overwhelmed. The morning went poorly. Had a bad workout. My computer suddenly turned off and may be broken. I'm so tired. And work was stressful. And I have to push through another they minutes of cooking before I can just lie down in the floor and stare at the ceiling until it's bedtime.
