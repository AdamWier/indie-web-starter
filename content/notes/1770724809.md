You see, the problem is, I'm trying to be too many people. But how could I stop being even one of them? How do you decide which arm to cut off? You don't. You just keep growing these arms and legs and eyes and ears until you've become a mutant. And you walk around the world that way. In all the glory and all the horror. Because very few could ever willingly separate out a cherished part of themselves and throw it in the trash.
