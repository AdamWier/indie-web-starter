So this kid is hitting meditating people in the face with like a long stick or fan or something, and my Buddhist brain is like, "is that a keisaku??? You're not supposed to be hitting people in the face with one of those, child!" But good reflex on bringing the sleeping ones out of their slumber and back into the moment.
