I knew what spoon theory was and what it meant but today is the first time I read the story of where it all came from. Wow. In this time that I'm teetering (back) into burnout, I can relate. As I try to muster up the energy to cook or else I'll have no lunch for tomorrow. It was a day that I started with a spoon deficit and on getting home I hung the laundry to dry and my headache has me lying down but... tick tock tick tock, can't wait too long or I'll not get to bed on time. #spoontheory
