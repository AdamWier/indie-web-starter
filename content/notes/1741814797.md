I recently finished the Hyperion Cantos series and I've been thinking about some of the ideas... Notably what happens at the end of the second book and how I see it as a metaphor to what some of us in the fediverse and indieweb are trying to do in terms of tech and healing that part of our society. I'm going to try to write a blog post or maybe do a video talking about it. I just hope it's intelligible to others. ðŸ˜¬
