I'm visiting Rennes for the first time. Traveling by myself, which is generally my preference. One reason I like that is because I'll naturally start to people watch and eavesdrop a bit. The bartender is talking to a friend at the bar and he said, "I had no one to have raclette with so I just had it all by myself!" A man after my own heart. You don't need anyone to enjoy cheese! Sometimes it's even better to enjoy the cheese alone! Hi ho the dairy-o!
