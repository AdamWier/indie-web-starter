Everything is in place for a nice little solo Christmas. Third year in a row! I have decided the customary film (Arrival), and the game for tomorrow is a tie between Expedition 33 and a combo of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and The Beginner's Guide. It's mostly down to if I feel like I should spend that money. After the major purchases last week, I should slow my roll

Doing this holiday alone is one of the best decisions I even made!
