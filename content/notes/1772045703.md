So I'm an extreme novice in home improvement. I just attempted to drill into my ceiling with the wrong kind of drill. (I realized this after when it seemed like something was not right.) There's a small hole there now. It's small and it's not a big deal. I'm pretty sure repairing it will take fifteen minutes max when I get whatever goop I'm supposed to fill it with, but I'm bummed.
That is all. :(
