I can't help but feel I've done something wrong and that people who I used to count as friends have drifted away. Maybe that's just life. Maybe it's my mental state talking, which is not great lately. This deserves time of its own to think about. Maybe I should just get away a little bit. Despite what I'm saying now, having today and tomorrow off is really helping. Maybe a week or even just a weekend away, somewhere else, somewhere away from the complexities of my life, would do me some good.
