Throwing this out there in case someone's figured it out....
I'd like my loops account link on Mastodon to appear as verified. I was able to do this with my Bookwrym account because the bio accepts html. Loops doesn't. Has anyone managed to do the rel=me necessary for the verification? Or maybe there's another way? Not a big deal but would be cool if I could do it. (Also completely understand why html is not accepted and surprised that I can in Bookwyrm!)
