Just wrote a strongly worded message to my superior his lack of rigor. Most of that team really. (He is my manager but we do not work in the same team...) Said this cannot continue. It's the equivalent of handing off work and instead of giving you organized files, they throw a wad of crumpled up papers at you and tell you to sort it out. I was hoping team spirit would be enough, but I guess I must instill fear that I will come down on them like a ton of bricks. These are adults, by the way.
