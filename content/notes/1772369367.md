Found a quick 45 minutes to add a link to my loops profile tommy website and integrate the videos into my unified feed! Always move to be amor to do a quick little update to the site but honestly the code is so slapdash that it makes my eyes bleed. (And it's my own code! 😭) One of these days I'll get around to cleaning it up.
