I don't understand what I'm feeling. Depression? Exhaustion? Heartbreak? Maybe even fear? Dissatisfaction? Something just isn't quite right. I'm not sure what to do about it because I don't know what it is. It's so subtle I can hardly hear it but it's constantly there. Been going on for days, I think even weeks.
