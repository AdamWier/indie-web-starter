I swear I'll finish my little essay on Hyperion and Big Tech one of these days! I was able to carve out an hour or so of my schedule to work on it today. What's embarrassing is that it's not that long. Probably a 10 minute read, but I just want to do a good job. I keep saying I'll find more time to write but then what should I give up to find that time? I have so many little projects I want to do.
