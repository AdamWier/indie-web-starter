Actually one more. 😅 
I think the reason I have a bee in my bonnet over this scene is because it once again rests on "I'm just like you", as if sexuality is some detail or afterthought. It's not uncommon for a child to say, but the script clearly switches tone and it's the writers having a moment, not the character. 
The social ramifications of our sexuality often send us on very different life trajectoires and outlooks. For the better and for the worse. Acknowledging that is true acceptance.
