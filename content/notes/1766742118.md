I've been having brain zaps for about a week now and just generally not feeling right. Sometimes my heart feels a bit heavy and worn out. Tinnitus acting up. So despite really wanting to get things done today, I'm having to pump the brakes. I've been lying in bed a couple extra hours after a light workout this morning. I can feel brain zaps waiting in the wings and I'm trying to stave then off. This is not the day I had planned but I guess it's the day I'm going to have.
