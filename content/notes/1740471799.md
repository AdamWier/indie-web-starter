Ever since returning back from the Netherlands, I've been so happy. I feel like one of those cartoon characters that floats around and sings because they're lovestruck.
Well, pushing aside about 24 hours of missing them.... (Me? Miss someone? That's rarely ever happened and was a very new experience!)
Just got time off and a ticket to go back at the end of March.
(Please bear with me. ðŸ™ƒ)
