If white Americans want to know what it's like to have your food gentrified, come to France. 
Also, lots of things are called American that I have never in my life seen it in the US.
Lastly, French people can't tell what's actually Mexican food and what's TexMex. Then they don't believe you when you tell them.
I'm thinking of all this because I just bought something from the grocery store called "Mexican nachos" which are neither Mexican nor nachos. But they're good.
