Just got to the epilogue in Bayonetta before I head to stop and prepare for a lunch guest. Man this game has been a wild ride. Much fun. So camp. ðŸ’ƒ But I can't claim to totally understand the story. I'll have to do a careful internet dive afterwards... But delicately because I intend to play 2 and 3! #bayonetta #videogames #camp #gay #gaming #sega #hackandslasg #hacknslash #gaymer #confused #story #plot #witches
