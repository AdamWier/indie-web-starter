I finally got a good night of sleep but I had so many dreams. They include: 

A post apocalyptic society that recreated ancient civilizations. The main character's father and her were captured by the Greeks. She was raised as part of the Greek royal family but learned that she was Egyptian so she freed him and they returned to Egyptian society.

Also, a dream I was actually in where a guy asked me why I was gay after saying I sounded and acted too gay, and me and two other people backed him into a corner repeating "Why are you straight?" till he got intimidated and freaked out because he didn't know the answer. 

Also some soldier disciplined some child for getting to rowdy with his ball.

Your guess is as good as mine.
