Do you all ever feel this way? I really like people. I want to talk to them, understand them, laugh with them, cry with them, live with them, be in communion with them... But that means speaking, moderating myself, doing interpersonal math, and really just a lot of needless overhead. Does anyone understand the feeling I'm trying to name?
