I had a nightmare last night. I was getting ready to go on stage, getting my costume on but also helping other people. Then suddenly it was time for me to go on, and I couldn't find my shirt. I searched everywhere. The play stalled, they ended the act early and started the second without me. My big monologue! Lost because I was busy helping people and not getting dressed! I burst into hysterical tears. I woke up, still crying hysterically for another minute. It was awful.
