A friend sent me a link to an AI output of a question we had discussed a few days earlier. I sent him this:

Video title: Signal's Meredith Whittaker says Chat GPT can't be trusted
Desc: When Isikoff asked Whittaker a question that had been generated by ChatGPT about a Signal report that didn't exist, Whittaker called the chatbot "a bulls*** engine."
"Why are we using a bullshit machine for anything serious?"
