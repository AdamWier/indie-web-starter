So here's a fun thing I woke up to this morning... Apparently at some point (I'm guessing two nights ago but not really sure) someone shat in front of my door, covered it with the place mat, and then stomped on it. I'm not saying it was fascists but I do have a pride flag out front, which has already been snatched down once and I've got a "Jesus saves" sticker on the door before. So you know, forgive me if I can't help but to feel like this is kind of on purpose.
