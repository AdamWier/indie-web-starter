I need some general how to be a human advice. 

If you see someone crying in public, should you go ask them if they're okay? 

If they're obviously hurt, it makes sense you should, but let's say they seem physically fine. I'm stuck between wanting to help and not wanting to intrude on what might be a private moment where they need to feel some things. 

What do you all do?
