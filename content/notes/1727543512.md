The barman & a friend of his are talking & he says (in French) "in any case, after a while there were too many people, too much poppers and I decided to go." Naturally I laugh & his friend turns to me & says (in English) "you manage to understand some of what we're saying?" & I say (in French) "dude I've been living in France for eight, actually nine years." "Oh, so you're basically French." "The naturalisation application is under review."
