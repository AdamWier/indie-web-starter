I just woke up from another bad dream. I'm not sure if you can call this one a nightmare because I normal associate them with fear and this was sadness, stress. Stuff happened before but the part I remember starts at being in the bus and it goes past the stop. No big deal. But then it keeps going and curves around until it loops back to where it was. As it goes further past I stress more and more and eventually it stops at an area similar to by l'Erdre. Then I get out and ass the bus driver is walking away, presumably to go where all the bus drivers have a break, I yell to here that she really messed me up and now I'm going to be late. I call her a connasse (like French for asshole or bitch) as she goes into the break room. She hears it and comes out and follows me, yelling and furious. I continue to try to walk but my legs won't work. I have to take pauses, I fall. I eventually make it to school. I'm suddenly shirtless with kind of like big baggy quasi Japanese pants. I walk in front of everyone. They're weirded out about my appearance. I make it to the bathroom but it's filled with people. I don't understand and can't get in. I make my way upstairs and I see that it's the day that we were meant to do a pseudo press conference for social studies (but it's taught by Se√±ora Thoreson, my high school Spanish teacher). I run away and break down and cry. I can't get to her to explain my day, and that school has been closed for days and I forgot and I prepared nothing and if she could please just have some mercy on me because this will completely tank my grades. They're another person crying. I wake up crying. 

I think I might be a little stressed.
