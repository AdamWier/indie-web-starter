Wind rushing by my ears  
Branches slap my face  
Speed increasing  
As gravity drags me down  
Into its bosom  
Woosh, whack, whiz  
As I wake up  
To a once hidden nightmare.

The wind whirrs its whispers and insinuations in my ear  
Hissing doubt, discord, and distrust  
Memories that refuse to be ignored and pushed aside,  
They drone in their ceaseless murmur  
Voices that forbid me clarity in these final moments.

The boughs assault me one by one  
Feigning their support  
False friendsÂ   
They rob me  
Of the liberation  
Of free fall.  
<br/>Faster I go,  
Unable to stop,  
Unable  
To stop  
Myself,  
I brace  
For impact.  
The end  
Is before  
Me and  
My course  
Is set.  
There  
Is  
No  
Dignity  
Where  
Control  
Is  
Lost.

*And now I have awoken brutally and cruelly to this cosmic nightmare from which there is no escape because I have always, unwittingly, been here.*
