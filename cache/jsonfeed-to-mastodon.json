I believe you should not give strangers advice unless they ask for it. Ideally you should not give anyone advice. What you should do instead, if anything, is ask them questions to help them figure out what would help them. But I guess that doesn't give people the same ego boost now does it?\n#mastodon #advice\n",

    "content_text": "Tonight I broke down with a friend in tears. I spoke about multiple incidents that, in my eyes, have broken the small community I have tried to create. I felt I had lost the family I had worked so hard to create, feeling I've never really had one. I've had a hard time expressing what I feel but I think she's the first to give me a clue on how to get back on my feet. She showed me all is not lost. Pieces are still there to pick up.\nShe truly is a good friend.\n#friends #community #life #leftism\n",
