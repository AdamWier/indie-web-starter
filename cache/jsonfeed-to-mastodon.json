    "content_text": "One of the things I don't understand is how people don't associate degrowth as a strategy to tackle climate change with more leisure time. Ideally degrowth would start by stopping over production. That seems to me to lead naturally to less work and more leisure. Am I crazy for that? Is dreaming of leisure that impossible? It isn't if we free ourselves from the tyranny of the profit motive. #leftism #climatechange #degrowth #communism #anarchism #politics #dream #dreaming",

    "content_text": "Sad to skip deadlifts today. But as soon as I feel anything out of the ordinary I say nope. I once injured myself so bad that I'm pretty sure it what triggered a non cancerous tumor that I had to be operated on to remove. Not to mention the pain I was in for a week or two. It's my weakest lift and my favorite lift but I'd rather be cautious and be able to come back tomorrow than be out for a week or more because I was stubborn. #gym #workout #health #fitness #weightlifting #deadlifts #deadlift",
