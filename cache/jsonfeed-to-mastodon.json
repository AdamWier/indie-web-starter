I believe you should not give strangers advice unless they ask for it. Ideally you should not give anyone advice. What you should do instead, if anything, is ask them questions to help them figure out what would help them. But I guess that doesn't give people the same ego boost now does it?\n#mastodon #advice\n",

I've had a hard time expressing what I feel but I think she's the first to give me a clue on how to get back on my feet. She showed me all is not lost.

I have seen the best and worst of our world. And I feel lucky for it. The best has allowed me to survive, and the worst has allowed me develop a compassion for others and a sense of justice for the world I wish to see.\n",
