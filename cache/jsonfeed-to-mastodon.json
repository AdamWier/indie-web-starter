My partner abandoned me during my second month of the job and now our project is very behind. So suffice it to say, I don't have much respect for him. And I'm nervous the manager is going to ask how things are going and I'll have to have a difficult conversation that I'm not in the mood for.\n#work #stress #burnout #anxiety #dread #diplomacy\n",
